            The reading group meets weekly on <strong>Wednesday, 10am</strong> during term time and is open to the
            public.
            We read both new papers and classics in the field of distributed systems and security.
            Occasionally, we also discuss pre-prints and critique work-in-progress papers.
            Papers are shared via the mailing list on Monday morning, giving everyone ample time to read them before the
            meeting.
